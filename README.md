# Portfolio

This portfolio showcases the work that I did while in the full-stack software engineering program at Prime Digital Academy in Minneapolis, MN. The first is my solo project called Voyager, which is a travel/bucket list of places and events the user wants to go to. The user can add, remove, and edit any of the items listed upon logging in. The second was a group project effort which involved a Google Maps site database. The non-profit client wanted to update and improve the user experience in regards to researching and showcasing architecture from the Modern movement within Minnesota and the surrounding Mid-West.
